  abstract: 'Agentic systems require coordination mechanisms that traditional database
    concurrency control cannot provide. While Data MVCC resolves conflicts through
    data representation—normalizing facts to canonical addresses where conflicts are
    structural—agentic systems face a fundamentally different challenge: multiple
    reasoning components reading the shared state and emitting intents that may not
    both be permissible given system constraints. We introduce Semantic MVCC, a framework
    for transactional state management in agentic systems. The core insight is that
    agentic memory should serve as a reasoning surface where state, recall, inference,
    and update are unified operations. We define Semantic ACID guarantees, present
    a practical implementation based on append-only intent logging with deterministic
    state derivation, and demonstrate the framework through case studies in insurance
    underwriting and trading desks. The architecture requires no novel primitives—it
    composes event sourcing, snapshot isolation, and domain-specific resolution functions
    into an auditable, replayable system suitable for regulated industries.

  title: 'Seven Verbs: A Theory of Human Judgment in AI-Augmented Production Systems'

  abstract: 'This paper proposes a seven-verb taxonomy for characterizing human work
    in AI-augmented en- vironments. Through dual independent deriva- tion—from organizational
    outputs backward and from irreducible human capacities forward—we identify seven
    verbs that describe the complete set of human contributions that persist when
    artificial intelligence handles execution: WANT (originate in- tent), INTERROGATE
    (pressure test output), TASTE (judge quality), OWN (bear consequences), ATTEST
    (stake reputation), WITNESS (provide presence), and CONVENE (align humans). We
    validate this taxonomy against 1,000 occupations in the U.S. De- partment of Labor’s
    O*NET database across 23 job families. All seven verbs load across all job families;
    none are orphaned. The distribution reveals ATTEST (85%) and TASTE (68%) as near-universal,
    INTER- ROGATE (47%) and OWN (44%) as core to decision roles, and WITNESS (27%),
    WANT (25%), and CON- VENE (19%) as specialized human-presence func- tions. We
    argue that the primary economic value of AI augmentation lies not in labor substitution
    but in decision quality improvement: same people, same hours, much better decisions.
    We further identify failure modes when each verb degrades and derive implications
    for organizational design, governance, and workforce development.'

  title: 'The Benjamin Button Problem: Ashby''s Constraint and the Agentic Enterprise'
  authors:
  - Iyer, Rajesh S
  date: '2025-12-31'
  category: ai-systems
  slug: ben_button
  abstract: 'The industry tried to be born old—deploying agents before earning the
    governance  to sustain them. For eighteen months, the narrative held that LLMs
    reason like  humans, therefore agents everywhere. That story skipped the hard
    parts: governance,  credibility, institutional risk, coordination cost. Enterprises
    didn''t reject agents.  They priced them correctly. This paper argues for aging
    backwards: beginning with  GenAI-augmented automation, graduating to agentic patterns,
    and instantiating agents  only as a reward for earned governance. The theoretical
    foundation combines Ashby''s  Law of Requisite Variety with Blackman''s insight
    on stability: you cannot govern a  high-variety system with a low-variety regulator,
    and low-frequency governance cannot  stably control high-frequency agent behavior.
    Together, these constraints define a  regime boundary—below which deterministic
    governance suffices, above which agentic  governance becomes mandatory. Crucially,
    GenAI itself enables the crossing: by  augmenting governance at computational
    frequency, it solves the frequentist problem  that makes agentic governance possible.

    via GPU-Accelerated Completion and Decomposition'

  slug: dq-tensor-methods-for-data-quality-validation-in-business-in
  abstract: 'We introduce τDQ (tau-DQ), a GPU-accelerated framework for detecting
    missing and potentially inaccurate data in business intelligence through tensor
    methods. Unlike conventional profiling that validates individual fields, τDQ identifies
    struc- tural anomalies in multi-dimensional relationships. Tensor completion surfaces
    gaps—expected combinations that are missing from the data. Tensor decomposition
    flags suspicious values—records that exist but don’t fit the low-rank structure
    of valid busi- ness data. Together, these techniques catch data quality failures
    invisible to rule-based validation: the missing regional coverage, the transaction
    that shouldn’t exist, the KPI attribution that violates hierarchy.τDQ achieves
    25–30× speedup over Spark-RAPIDS while detecting 73% more structural defects than
    traditional approaches.'
