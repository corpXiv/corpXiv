This paralysis is the greater risk. A companion paper established Ashby\u2019s Constraint: you cannot govern exponential capability with linear processes. This paper operationalizes the escape hatch. We present a fear taxonomy, demonstrate how GenAI-based governance resolves each fear, and provide an implementation sequence for builders. The key insight: where reasonable minds can differ, human review introduces variance\u2014the very risk governance exists to prevent. AI provides consistency; humans provide accountability. GenAI governs GenAI. Humans own consequences. The architecture is proposed, not proven. The primitives exist. The integration awaits practitioners willing to build, challenge, and refine.", "category": "architecture", "date": "2026-01-02", "warnings": []}
