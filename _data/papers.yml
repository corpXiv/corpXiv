  abstract: 'We introduce τDQ (tau-DQ), a GPU-accelerated framework for detecting
    missing and potentially inaccurate data in business intelligence through tensor
    methods. Unlike conventional profiling that validates individual fields, τDQ identifies
    struc- tural anomalies in multi-dimensional relationships. Tensor completion surfaces
    gaps—expected combinations that are missing from the data. Tensor decomposition
    flags suspicious values—records that exist but don’t fit the low-rank structure
    of valid busi- ness data. Together, these techniques catch data quality failures
    invisible to rule-based validation: the missing regional coverage, the transaction
    that shouldn’t exist, the KPI attribution that violates hierarchy.τDQ achieves
    25–30× speedup over Spark-RAPIDS while detecting 73% more structural defects than
    traditional approaches.'
