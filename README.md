# corpXiv

**An open preprint archive for enterprise practitioners.**

arXiv for industry — where practitioners formalize rigorous thinking into papers, not slide decks.

## What is corpXiv?

corpXiv is a community-driven repository of technical papers from enterprise practitioners. No paywalls. No gatekeepers. Just rigorous ideas, properly documented.

We believe the best thinking in enterprise technology lives inside companies — trapped in internal wikis, lost in Slack threads, buried in vendor-speak. corpXiv is where that thinking escapes.

All papers follow the **corpXiv style**:

| Element | Specification |
| --- | --- |
| Layout | 2-column |

| Citations | BibTeX, numeric style |
| Format | PDF (LaTeX-compiled preferred) |

The format is the point. Papers demand structure that forces clarity.

## Quality Standards

corpXiv is open, not unfiltered. Papers should:

1. **Solve a real problem** — No thought experiments without grounding
2. **Show the work** — Methodology matters
3. **Be honest about limitations** — We're practitioners, not salespeople
4. **Cite prior art** — Ideas build on ideas

Quality signal is citations. Papers that matter get referenced.
